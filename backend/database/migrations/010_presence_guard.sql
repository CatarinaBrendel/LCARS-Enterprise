-- Goal:
--  1) Only one active (ended_at IS NULL) triage_visit per crew.
--  2) Faster presence lookups for Med Bay overrides.
-- Policy A: treat ('admitted','under_treatment','triage','recovering') as Med Bay.

BEGIN;

-- 0) Clean up any existing duplicates so the unique index can be created.
--    Keep the most recent active visit per crew; close the rest as discharged.

--    (Note: If your migration runner wraps in a transaction, avoid CONCURRENTLY.)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS uniq_active_visit_per_crew

-- 2) Presence fast path: index exactly matches your presence filter.

-- Optional safety: discharged rows must have ended_at
